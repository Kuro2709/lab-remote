01-HTML:
I completed this section on my own without any help. The exercise is helpful a bit, help me to understand how to create a basic web page. For the kittens and puppies image, I can not find any image with the specific 200x150 so I think the image should be more clear, like you should have the source image in the assets, not online. This was the first exercise so there is not other exercises that helpful.

02-a11ly:
I completed this exercise with a bit help from the TA because I could not find the markdown file. The exercise is kinda easy but not much helpful. I think you should add a markdown file instead of doc reposotory(I saw it on github). The first exercise(01-HTML) can help this one a lot because these two are similar.

03-css:
I completed this section with a bit help from the css-trick website. The exercise is very helpful, it help me improve my design skills for the front-end development. One problem i have when doing this excercise is I can't see the example on the github, which is very inconvience because I need to pull out the image in the assets everytime I do or change the exercise. The first exercise 01-HTML might be helpful a bit but not much.

04-flexbox:
I completed this exercise with the help from the css-trick website. The exercise is very interesting and fun to play with. It also improve my CSS skills a bit. The example for each task is very specific. The 03-css excercise is a bit helpful for this one.

05-css-grid:
I completed this exercise with the help from the css-trick website. This exercise is also interesting but harder than the last one. The tasks help me know how to customize each grid items. However, the example for the second part of the exercise is not clear enough. I did't know how to string the grid. This excercise is a different catogory so other exercises didn't help much.

06-boostrap:

07-javascript:
I completed this exercise with a bit help from chatGPT. The exercise is not really hard but took me sometime because the JavaScript code. The exercise is helpful cause I could learn JavaScript a lot. The tasks were clear enough so no need more explaination. I could not find any exercise that could help I learn this exercise a bit better.

08-jquery:
I completed this exercise with a bit help from chatGPT. This exercise is kinda the same type of the javascript exercise, which help me learned another language. The tasks were also very clear. This exercise is also a new language exercise so I don't think other exercises could help.
